# Static Site Deployment Guide

## Converting to Static Site for GitHub Pages

Your Pond0x Dashboard is already suitable for static hosting since all functionality runs client-side. Here's how to deploy it:

### GitHub Pages Deployment Steps

1. **Export Project to GitHub**
   - Use Replit's "Version Control" tab to create a GitHub repository
   - Or manually export files and create a new GitHub repo

2. **Build Static Files**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates a `dist` folder with your static files.

3. **GitHub Pages Setup**
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose `main` branch and `/dist` folder
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### Alternative Hosting Options

#### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Output directory: `dist`
4. Automatic deployments on git push

#### Netlify
1. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify
2. Or connect GitHub for automatic deployments
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`

### What's Already Static-Ready

✅ **Client-Side Only**: All functionality runs in the browser  
✅ **External APIs**: Direct calls to Cary0x, pond0x.com, and Helius  
✅ **Local Storage**: Wallet memory uses browser localStorage  
✅ **No Backend Dependencies**: Express server only serves files in development  

### Files to Include in GitHub Repository

**Essential Files:**
- `client/` - All React frontend code
- `shared/` - Type definitions
- `attached_assets/` - Images and assets
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Lock file
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `README.md` - Documentation

**Optional for Static Deployment:**
- `server/` - Not needed for static hosting
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Database config (unused)
- `.replit` - Replit-specific configuration

### Environment Variables

For production deployment, ensure these are set if needed:
- External API endpoints are hardcoded in the application
- No sensitive backend environment variables required

### Performance Optimizations

The current build already includes:
- Tree shaking for minimal bundle size
- Asset optimization through Vite
- TypeScript compilation
- Tailwind CSS purging

Your dashboard is perfectly suited for static hosting and will work exactly the same as it does on Replit!
