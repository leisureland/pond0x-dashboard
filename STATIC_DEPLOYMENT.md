# Static Deployment Notes

## Current Status
Your Pond0x Dashboard is successfully deployed as a static site on Vercel!

## What Works in Static Mode
✅ **Pond0x Data**: All authentic Pond0x ecosystem data loads correctly
- Manifest data from Cary0x API  
- Mining session data from pond0x.com
- PondPro subscription status
- Boost calculations and swap data

✅ **Core Features**: 
- Wallet address input and validation
- Solscan integration with transaction filters
- Wallet memory functionality
- All UI components and styling

## Static Deployment Optimizations
- Individual components handle their own API calls to external services
- Pond0x Manifest and Mining components connect directly to authentic APIs
- Error handling provides clear user feedback
- Focused on Solana addresses (Pond0x ecosystem requirement)

## Next Steps for Full Features
To enable complete transaction history and multi-chain data:
1. Deploy the full stack version (backend + frontend)
2. Configure API keys for Helius (Solana) and Alchemy (Ethereum)
3. Enable full historical transaction analysis

## Current Live URL
Your dashboard is live and functional for Pond0x data analysis!
